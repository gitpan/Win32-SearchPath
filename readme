Win32/SearchPath version 0.02
=============================

Win32::SearchPath - Perl extension for the Win32 API SearchPath.

SYNOPSIS

  use Win32::SearchPath;

  $FullPath = SearchPath ('perl');
  $FullPath = SearchPath ('perl', 'C:\\Bin;C:\\Perl\Bin;D:\\Bin');

DESCRIPTION

This module is specifically for use with Win32::Process::Create.  That interface
requires the full path name of the executable, which SearchPath provides.

   $FULL_PATH = SearchPath(FILENAME)

Search for the specified FILENAME in the standard Windows search path.  
By default the extension ".exe" is added to FILENAME, but this is ignored 
if it already has an extension.  

Alternatively a specific 'Path' list may be specified:

   $FULL_PATH = SearchPath(FILENAME,PATHLIST)

PATHLIST must be a list of directory names separated by semi-colons (';').  Only 
these directory names will be searched for FILENAME, sub-directories are not 
searched unless they are specifically included in the list.  

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module will only run on Microsoft Windows, and requires a C compiler, a
linker, and a 'make' utility for installation.
